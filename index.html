        <h2>Amazing Facts About the Lion</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Lions are the only big cats to live in groups, called prides. Prides are close family groups. They work
                together to defend territory and hunt.

            <li>
                The females in the pride tend to do the majority of the hunting. They work as a group and use
                intelligent hunting tactics to catch prey which they would not be able to catch alone as they are faster
                than them.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lions enjoy relaxing and lazing around. They spend between 16 and 20 hours each day resting and
                sleeping. They have few sweat glands so they wisely tend to conserve their energy by resting during the
                day and become more active at night when it is cooler.
